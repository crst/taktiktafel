      </header>

      <p>Taktiktafel is a chalkboard for a soccer match, running in
      the browser. It is written in JavaScript and stores data locally
      using <i>Web Storage</i>, therefore it basically works
      offline.</p>


      <!-- ################################################################# -->
      <!-- Overview -->

        <h2>Interface Overview</h2>
        <img src="http://www.foldl.de/2aa6106ef175ab3fef6925c369757e90/gfx/manual/overview.jpg" title="Taktiktafel overview" />

        The interface can be divided into five different regions that
        are highlighted in the screenshot on the left:
        <ol>
          <li>The <strong style="color: yellow;">pitch</strong>.</li>
          <li>An area for the <strong style="color: red;">home team</strong>.</li>
          <li>An area for the <strong style="color: red;">away team</strong>.</li>
          <li>A <strong style="color: skyblue;">timeline</strong>.</li>
          <li>A <strong style="color: forestgreen;">controls</strong> bar.</li>
        </ol>
        Players can be moved anywhere along the pitch or on one of the
        team areas. You can connect players with a line, or draw on
        the pitch. The current state of the players and the pitch can
        be saved with an entry on the timeline, or loaded from such an
        existing entry.
      </section>


      <!-- ################################################################# -->
      <!-- Players -->
      <section>
        <hr />
        <h2>Move Players</h2>
        <img src="http://www.foldl.de/2aa6106ef175ab3fef6925c369757e90/gfx/manual/player.jpg" title="Players on the pitch" />

        <p>You can move the players along the pitch simply by dragging
        them with the left mouse button pressed. In the screenshot on
        the left you can see an example where all players from one
        team are positioned on the pitch.</p>
        
        <p>What you can also see is that the players have "names" (or
        descriptions) associated with them. If you move the mouse
        below the circle that represents the player, you can enter
        these displayed names.</p>

        <p>You can also change the colors of a team by changing the
        color values in the box at the top of the corresponding team's
        area.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Draw Things</h2>
        <img src="http://www.foldl.de/2aa6106ef175ab3fef6925c369757e90/gfx/manual/drawing.jpg" title="Drawing on the pitch" />

        <p>You can draw on the pitch by moving the mouse with the left
        mouse button pressed. Select the color from one of the boxes
        on the left side of the "Controls" region.</p>

        <p>Click the "Clear" button to remove all drawings from the
        pitch, or select the <i>erase</i> color left to the "Clear"
        button to remove drawings just as if you were drawing.
      </section>


      <!-- ################################################################# -->
      <!-- Connections -->
      <section>
        <hr />
        <h2>Connect Players</h2>
        <img src="http://www.foldl.de/2aa6106ef175ab3fef6925c369757e90/gfx/manual/connections.jpg" title="Connecting players" />

        <p>You can connect players with a line. The line is created
        the first time you right-click on a player, and then follows
        the mouse until you right-click a second time on a player. If
        it is a different player, the line will connect both, if it is
        the same player the line will be removed.</p>

        <p>These connections differ from the drawings, because they
        follow the movements of the players.</p>

        <p>To remove an existing connection, left-click on the
        line.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Take Snapshots</h2>
        <img src="http://www.foldl.de/2aa6106ef175ab3fef6925c369757e90/gfx/manual/marker.jpg" title="A number of snapshots" />

        <p>You can left-click anywhere on the timeline to create a
        snapshot of the current state of the pitch. The snapshot will
        be represented by a marker "<b>X</b>" on the timeline.</p>

        <p>If you then change something on the pitch (for example by
        clicking on the "Reset Pitch" button to remove all connections
        and reset the player positions), you can restore the previous
        state by left-clicking on the marker that was placed on the
        timeline.</p>

        <p>A right-click on the marker will remove it, as well as the
        snapshot associated with it. Clicking the "Remove Saved Data"
        Button will remove all saved states.</p>

        <p>If your browser supports <i>Web Storage</i> the snapshots
        will be saved by the browser, so that they are not lost when
        the browser (or tab) is closed. Beware however that only the
        snapshots are saved, <strong>not</strong> the current state of
        the pitch. Also note that <i>Web Storage</i>
        does <strong>not</strong> work cross-browser. To remove all
        locally stored data, click the "Remove Saved Data" button.</p>
